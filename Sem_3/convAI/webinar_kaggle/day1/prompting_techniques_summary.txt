Sure! Here's a summary of the whitepaper companion podcast on prompt engineering, along with the techniques mentioned and their descriptions:

### Summary
The podcast dives into the concept of prompt engineering, emphasizing its importance in leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). It highlights that prompt engineering is accessible to everyone, not just coding experts. The discussion covers various techniques to fine-tune LLM outputs, making them more useful and accurate.

### Techniques and Descriptions

1. **Temperature**
   - **Description**: Controls the creativity of the LLM's responses. High temperature leads to more creative and unpredictable outputs, while low temperature results in more predictable and factual answers.

2. **Top K**
   - **Description**: Limits the LLM to use only the top K most likely words for each prediction step, narrowing down the vocabulary and making the output more relevant.

3. **Top P (Nucleus Sampling)**
   - **Description**: Uses a probability threshold to consider words that together add up to a certain probability, ensuring more coherent and focused responses.

4. **Zero Shot Prompting**
   - **Description**: Involves giving the LLM a task without any examples, relying on its training to generate a response.

5. **One Shot and Few Shot Prompting**
   - **Description**: Provides the LLM with one or a few examples to learn from, improving its ability to perform the task by demonstration.

6. **System Prompts**
   - **Description**: Sets the overall context for the LLM, such as defining it as a helpful assistant or a factual encyclopedia, guiding its behavior and responses.

7. **Role Prompts**
   - **Description**: Assigns a personality or role to the LLM, such as a travel guide or a code reviewer, to influence the tone and style of its responses.

8. **Contextual Prompts**
   - **Description**: Provides specific background information to the LLM to help it understand the context of the conversation or task.

9. **Step Back Prompting**
   - **Description**: Encourages the LLM to consider a broader question before tackling the main task, leading to more creative and comprehensive responses.

10. **Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT)**
    - **Description**: Guides the LLM to explain its reasoning step by step, mimicking human problem-solving processes and improving logical reasoning.

11. **Self-Consistency**
    - **Description**: Runs the prompt multiple times to generate different chains of thought, then selects the most consistent answer across these runs to reduce bias and improve reliability.

These techniques collectively enhance the effectiveness of prompt engineering, making LLMs more accurate, creative, and useful for a variety of tasks. If you have any specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

1. **Temperature**
   - **Example**: 
     - High Temperature: "Write a story about a dragon who loves to bake cookies."
     - Low Temperature: "Explain the process of photosynthesis."

2. **Top K**
   - **Example**: 
     - "Generate a list of the top 5 most popular programming languages in 2024."

3. **Top P (Nucleus Sampling)**
   - **Example**: 
     - "Describe a futuristic city using a mix of common and uncommon words."

4. **Zero Shot Prompting**
   - **Example**: 
     - "Translate the following sentence into French: 'The weather is nice today.'"

5. **One Shot and Few Shot Prompting**
   - **Example**: 
     - One Shot: "Translate the following sentence into French: 'The weather is nice today.' Example: 'The weather is nice today.' -> 'Il fait beau aujourd'hui.' Now translate: 'I love learning new languages.'"
     - Few Shot: "Translate the following sentences into French: 'The weather is nice today.' -> 'Il fait beau aujourd'hui.' 'I enjoy reading books.' -> 'J'aime lire des livres.' Now translate: 'I love learning new languages.'"

6. **System Prompts**
   - **Example**: 
     - "You are a helpful assistant. Provide a summary of the latest news in technology."

7. **Role Prompts**
   - **Example**: 
     - "You are a travel guide. Describe the best places to visit in Paris."

8. **Contextual Prompts**
   - **Example**: 
     - "Given that the user is a beginner in programming, explain what a variable is in Python."

9. **Step Back Prompting**
   - **Example**: 
     - "Before writing a story about a haunted house, list some common elements found in ghost stories."

10. **Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT)**
    - **Example**: 
      - "Solve the math problem: 24 divided by 3. First, explain how you would approach the problem step by step."

11. **Self-Consistency**
    - **Example**: 
      - "Generate three different explanations for why the sky is blue, then choose the most consistent explanation."

These examples illustrate how each technique can be applied to guide the LLM in generating more accurate, creative, and useful responses. If you need further details or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
